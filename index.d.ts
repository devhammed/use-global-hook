/**
 * A hook store is a place to store state and some of the logic for updating it.
 *
 * Store is a very simple React hook (which means you can re-use it, use other
 * hooks within it, use your existing custom or third-party hooks, etc).
 *
 * You should wrap the hook function in `createGlobalHook` function with the first parameter which is the unique identifier for the hook.
 *
 * Wrapping the function means, in case of when creating dynamic hook function, any argument you intend to pass to your hook when will be applied automatically, you still have your function the way you declare it --- cheers! e.g  something like `counterStore(props.dynamicValue)` though this can only happen when registering the hook function in `<GlobalHooksProvider />`.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useState } from 'react'
 * import { createGlobalHook } from '@devhammed/use-global-hook'
 *
 * const counterStore = createGlobalHook('counterStore', () => {
 *   const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 *   const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
 *   const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1)
 *
 *   return { count, increment, decrement }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Note that hooks prop use useState hook from React for managing state
 * When you call setState it triggers components to re-render, so be careful not
 * to mutate state directly or your components won't re-render.

/**
 * Class components can benefit from hooks too!
 *
 * You heard that right, who says class component cannot use and benefit from the awesomeness of React hooks?
use-global-hooks provides a function component HOC wrapper `withGlobalHooks` which allows class components to use hooks state(s) by passing them props. cool right? let's look at how above Counter component will look when using a class.
 * It is as easy as using function component too, just pass in your component variable as the first parameter and second parameter is an array that contains names of the global hooks you want to use and you will be able access the state from `this.props.[globalHookName]`.
 * The HOC wrapper pass down props so any other prop you are using in your component still works fine except if there is prop conflict which is why it is recommended you add `Store` suffix to your store names when creating them.
 * So with support for class component, you can start using this library even when you are not ready to switch to function components.
 * NOTE: You can also use `withGlobalHooks` with function components but why not just use the hook? :wink:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { withGlobalHooks } from '@devhammed/use-global-hook'
 *
 * class Counter extends React.Component {
 *   render () {
 *     const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = this.props.counterStore
 *
 *      return (
 *        <div>
 *          <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
 *          <span>{count}</span>
 *          <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
 *          <button onClick={reset}>reset</button>
 *        </div>
 *     )
